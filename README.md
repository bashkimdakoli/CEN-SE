Project CEN 3
Topic : Bussines Management System.
Business Management Systems (BMS) are great in theory.  They offer you the tools and strategies to document your business processes and define the way you work.  They are a standard method to achieve consistency and quality in everything you do.
After all, a Business Management System is only valuable if it is easy to use, helpful and recognisable as ‘the way your company does things’.
The aim of a BMS should be to place your business processes front and centre in the mind of your workforce. 
It should be the Quality System that ensures everyone in your company sees how you do things and why.
